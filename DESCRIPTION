Description: Unit tests to verify whether inputs for a stable marriage algorithm
    have been generated correctly from the source data system. These tests do 
    not verify that the matching algorithm itself is correct, but instead allow 
    the user to impose additional constraints on the lottery output in order to
    determine whether the input tables were queried using the proper rules.
